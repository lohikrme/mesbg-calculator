            <h2>About MESBG</h2>
            <p> MESBG is a miniature game based on The Lords of the Rings.
                The rules consist of a priority phase, a move phase, a shoot phase and a fight phase.
                Many events are solved by rolling dice, which makes this game
                heavily based on probability mathematics. This is why a warrior with better stats will not always win a
                fight.
                There are also lots of small rules which have their cumulative effect on the game,
                and heroes and monsters in general have all kind of special abilities and good stats compared to normal
                units.

            <h2>About these Calculators</h2>
            <p> I made these calculators to help players to finetune their armies and strategies.
                Traditionally, the assessment of probabilities has been based on simplified calculations, experience,
                even intuition. But now these calculators allows players to really see something new about MESBG.
                I hope this calculator will be useful for many players!
