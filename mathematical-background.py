# THE MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND OF THIS CALCULATOR AND INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In MESBG miniature game winning battles is determined by dice. There are 2 different situations.
# The more usual situation is when fight value (F) is different on both sides. The other situation is
# where the fight value (F) is identical on both sides.


# skilled_vs_weak()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For situations where fight value is different on both sides, we have the function called "skilled_vs_weak()",
# which will first calculate the probability that the opponent with weaker F will win, and from that determine
# the probability that the opponent with higher F will win.

# So, how does this mathematics work? Let's take 2 orcs (F3) vs 1 dwarf warrior (F4).
# The orcs would roll 2 dice and the dwarf would roll 1 dice, but if highest dice is equal. If orcs get higher single
# dice than dwarf, they win. For example 4,5 vs 2, and orcs win. But if dwarf gets equal or higher single dice than
# the orcs then the dwarf win. For example, the orcs get 5,5 and the dwarf gets 5, then the dwarf wins.

# Another example: The Balrog has 4 dice (F10) and fights 8 humans who have overall 8 dice (F3). So,
# if the Balrog gets 1,1,1,6 and the humans get 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6, then the Balrog wins due to having
# a higher fight value. If Balrog gets 5,5,4,5 and Humans get 1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1, then the humans win. And so on.

# To calculate this situation where the Balrog has 4 dice and the humans have 8 dice, we need to run through
# all next variations: Humans win with:
# 1x6, 2x6, 3x6, 4x6, 5x6, 6x6, 7x6, 8x6. (balrog gets less than 6)
# 1x5, 2x5, 3x5, 4x5, 5x5, 6x5, 7x5, 8x5. (balrog gets less than 5)
# 1x4, 2x4, 3x4, 4x4, 5x4, 6x4, 7x4, 8x4. (balrog gets less than 4)
# 1x3, 2x3, 3x3, 4x3, 5x3, 6x3, 7x3, 8x3. (balrog gets less than 3)
# 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 5x2, 6x2, 7x2, 8x2. (balrog gets less than 2)
# 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 4x1, 5x1, 6x1, 7x1, 8x1. (humans must use might to win with 1s)

# All these must be calculated separately. So, here is an example what humans win balrog 3x5 would look like:
# [explanation: 3x fives, 5x one-to-fours, all-different-orders-for-these, 4x under-fives]
# (1/6)^3*(4/6)^5*(8!/(3!*5!))*(4/6)^4 = 0.006744
# Note that humans get 3x5 which is (1/6)^3, also they get 5x lower than 5 which is (4/6)^5, and
# the different permutations for these dice rolls are (8!/(3!*5!)), while Balrog must get
# under 5 so Balrog must get (4/6)^4. All these must be considered in every 40 rounds of this calculation.

# how to add might to weak side... imagine the same situation, where humans (weak side) wins with 3 of fives
# but now we use 1 might point. then the component, where balrog had (4/6)^4,
# can grow up to (5/6)^4. meaning balrog can roll anything between 1 and 5, and humans win
# becuase if humans roll 5, it equals to 6
# just remember that if humans win with 6's, then the might wont help them

# what about adding might to strong side? imagine the same situation, where humans (weak side) wins with 3 of fives
# but now balrog uses 1 might point. in this situation, for weak side humans to win, balrog must roll
# between 1 and 3. if balrog gets 4, might will elevate it to 5 and humans lose
# therefore, where balrog had (4/6)^4
# now will be (3/6)^4
# just remember that the weak side cannot win with 2s at all (it would require balrog rolls to be 0/6)

# so, the key is to split the calculation into 4 parts:
# highest_weak_rolls_for_win, other weak_rolls_for_win, permutations, skilled_rolls
# and modify the part of skilled_rolls
# it is also important to comment these sections clearly into the code, so it is easier to modify them

# how to make a comprehensible loop to go through all cases
# first loop should be dice from 6 to 1. Meaning, will the weak side win with 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1
# the second loop should be from amount of dice to 1. Meaning, how many times weak side gets the winning number.

# this approach should work, as we are always first calculating the probability for the weak side to win,
# and figure out the probability for the skilled side to win via using complement


# equal_vs_equal()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We already addressed the probability maths behind this game quite deeply, so for this function
# the guide will be shorter! Please refer back if something is unclear.
# So, in situations where both opponents have an equal fight value, we must calculate three aspects:
# Case A: Left gets higher single dice than right
# Case B: Right gets higher single dice than left
# Case C: Both left and right get similarly high single dice.

# In A, left wins. In B, right wins. In C, the victory is determined by a lottery.
# The lottery works basically next: 123, evil wins, 456, good wins, which means 1/2 chance to win for both.
# But if only another side has an elf sword, then the elf sword's side wins 3456 and the other side wins 12.
# So the chance would be 2/3 for the elf sword's side and 1/2 for the normal sword's side.
# But in the very rare case that both sides have an elf sword, then it is again 123 evil 456 good = 1/2 chance for both.
# This is why this calculator needs not just the dice amount, but also a boolean about if either side
# has an elf sword.

# So, how to calculate this? Very easy after the first function. This time simply imagine that both enemies are
# "weaker opponent" in their fight value. So use the previous calculator and calculate with it to both directions.
# And then the amount of probability that stays between these two directions is the stalemate. So after this,
# just make if statements to check out for elven blades in all variations and then
# distribute the stalemate probability as already discussed.


# THE PROGRAM BEGINS:
